            Let's shake it up a little.
            Barry! Breakfast is ready!
            Coming!

            Hello?
            Barry?
            Adam?
            Can you believe this is happening?
            I can't.
            I'll pick you up.
            Looking sharp.
            Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
            Sorry. I'm excited.
            Here's the graduate.
            We're very proud of you, son.
            A perfect report card, all B's.
            Very proud.
            Ma! I got a thing going here.
            You got lint on your fuzz.
            Ow! That's me!
            Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
            Bye!
            Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
            Hey, Adam.
            Hey, Barry.
            Is that fuzz gel?
            A little. Special day, graduation.
            Never thought I'd make it.
            Three days grade school, three days high school.
            Those were awkward.
            Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
            You did come back different.
            Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
            Hear about Frankie?",
